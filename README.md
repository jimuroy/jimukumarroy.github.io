## About

I am an MBA candidate and Instructor in Dental Office Administration at Granville College, focused on preparing students to become confident, job-ready professionals for dental clinics across British Columbia.

I bring over a decade of experience spanning dental practice, clinic operations, education, and relationship management. My work sits at the intersection of healthcare service quality and operational execution—helping teams and learners perform accurately, communicate effectively, and deliver consistent patient experiences.

My professional foundation includes managing real-world dental workflows and translating clinical realities into structured administrative training. In parallel, my experience in import–export and relationship management strengthened my negotiation, CRM, and conflict-resolution capabilities—skills that directly support stakeholder management and operational stability in service environments.
